CSCI2720 Project  3 
Project Requirements:

4.[15 Points] (completed PT 1)
	PT 1) Add a private  function PtrToSuccessor that  finds  the  node with  the smallest  key value  in  a tree, and returns  a pointer  to that  node.

		template<class ItemType> TreeNode<ItemType>*  PtrToSuccessor(TreeNode<ItemType>*&  tree)

	PT 2) Modify  the DeleteNodefunction  so that  it  uses  the immediate  successor  (rather  than  the predecessor)  of the  value  to be deleted  in  the case of deleting  a node with  two children.  You should  callPtrToSuccessor() function  that  you  defined  in  part 3.

6.[15Points]
	Add to TreeType a public member  function MirrorImage that creates  and returns  a mirror image  of the  tree.
	The function MirrorImage calls a recursive function Mirror that  returns  the mirror  image  of the original  tree as follows: 
		
		TreeType<ItemType>  TreeType<ItemType>::MirrorImage();
		// Calls  recursive  function  Mirror.
		// Post:  A tree that  is  the  mirror  image  the tree is  returned.

8.[10Points]
	Test  your  implementation  using TreeDr.cpp.  This program must  display  a menu for  all  operations (you  can  use  and modify  the  attached  file  TreeDr.cpp).This program mustread all  input from  a text  file  called input.txt and  display output  on screen.
